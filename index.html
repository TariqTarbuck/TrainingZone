<h2> Mission Statement</h2>
<p> The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.  </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
